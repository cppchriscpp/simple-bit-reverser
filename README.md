# What is this?

This is a quick and dirty tool to reverse every bit of every byte in a file. 

Written to solve this, hopefully: https://twitter.com/moviemovies_one/status/1284673750185771008

## How do I use it?

```bash
./simple-bit-reverser name_of_file_to_reverse
```

It will create `name_of_file_to_reverse.out` in the same directory.

Binaries for both Windows and osx are in the `bin` directory. Alternatively if you have node installed, you can do:

```bash
node ./index.js name_of_file_to_reverse
```
